      this.engine = await window.ChatModule.CreateMLCEngine(selectedModel, {
        initProgressCallback: (progress) => {
          this.showLoading(`Loading model: ${Math.round(progress.progress * 100)}%`);
        }
      });
      
      await this.engine.reload(selectedModel, undefined, {
        systemPrompt: window.JAMES_CONTEXT
      });
      
      this.isInitialized = true;
